rental_rate and rental_duration are actually part of film since they describe the price of a title and the rental duration allowed for a title (Latest Marvel movie may be more in demand than "Mission Impossible 235: Electric Boogalo") so we will not move them

Flattened special_features column in Film table so it fits 3NF.

fixed the circular foreign key design in store-staff relationship by introducing a Store_staff link table. Also removed the foreign keys (store_id from Staff table and manager_staff_id from Store table) since they are redundant after introducing the link table.

update film table using a query: (insert picture or text)

remove film_text cuz it's just a repeat of film (data redundancy)
